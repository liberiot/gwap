 * Author: Daniel Berenguer
 * Creation date: 03/18/2016
 *
 * Device:
 * Dual Temperature + Humidity sensor
 *
 * Description:
 * This sketch generates a GWAP temperature+humidity sensor device
 * relying on HTU21D sensor and Sparkfun's library
 * https://github.com/sparkfun/HTU21D_Breakout
 *
 * This library and the current sketch is also compatible with Silabs'
 * SI7021 temperature+humidity sensor. SI7021 is the sensor that can be
 * hosted by panStamp NRG on the bottom layer.
 *
 * These devices are low-power enabled so they will enter low-power mode
 * just after reading the sensor values and transmitting them over the
 * GWAP network.
 *
 * Associated Device Definition Files, defining registers, endpoints and
 * configuration parameters:
